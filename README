== Setup (for localhost)

- 	Set up a bucket named "allweb" that points to the source url "http://"
- 	This application assumes that the imgbrew-backend app is running on port: 3242
- 	Grabbing an image via: 
		
		http://allweb.smackaho.st:3242/{application_host}:{application_port}/{image_path}/{commands}
  
	will retrieve the source image from: 
		
		http://{application_host}:{application_port}/{image_path}
		
	and apply the {commands} to it.
-	The demo application uses /public/uploads to store uploaded pictures, so the address it uses
	to retrieve them (and apply any commands) is:
	
		http://allweb.smackaho.st:3242/{application_host}:{application_port}/public/uploads/{commands}


- The following prefix is added to any of the files uploaded: http://allweb.smackaho.st:3242/127.0.0.1:3001
- It assumes that the port of the demo app is 3001 and that it is bound to 127.0.0.1

- The application expects the "uploads" directory to exist in the public folder, but it is not included in the repository
  - cd public
  - mkdir uploads
